----- (10/27/25)
1. Creating a subset of 10,000 rows to prevent overplotting.
2. Added sub_functions for plotting multiple types of plots
3. Added a master function for plotting to control the sub_function behavior

---- (10/30/25)
1. Decided to create seperate models for different stocks, gives better linear regression models
2. Made a named list to hold the different dataframes. Did this for easier lookup times and access.
3. Implemented functions for box_plots, and histograms
4. Probably need to reduce the stocks that we are looking (Still debating)

---- (10/31/25)
1. Implemented functions for time_series and boxplots.
2. Split the plotting functions in separate folder for easier access and debugging.
